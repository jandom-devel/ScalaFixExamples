# Instructions for the ScalaFix artifact

This artifact is a docker image containing both ScalaFix, the fixpoint library, and ScalaFixExample, the collection of all
the examples and benchmarks shown in the paper. Both the source code and compiled bytecode are provided. Moreover, the image
contains all the libraries, compilers and tools needed to execute examples and benchmarks, which may be eventually modified
and recompiled if desired.

The ZIP contains the files `License.txt` and this `README`, as required by the artifact guidelines. The `README` is actually
in Markdown format. The file `README.pdf` contains a PDF version of  `README`, while `scalafix-examples.tgz` is the Docker
image of the artifact.

Load this image in your Docker environment with

`docker load -i scalafix-examples.tgz`

Then, you can create a container and run it with

`docker run --rm -it scalafix-examples`

Due to this issue described in https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/9f6b562dd12ef7b1f9e2f8e6f2ab6477790a6594,
a recent version of Docker is required (20.10.16 or later should be fine).

The image `scalafix-examples` contains an installation of Fedora 36 with Scalafix and all its dependencies. Once started, the bash shell is executed as the user `scalafix` in the working directory `/home/scalafix/ScalaFixExamples`. This directory contains the source code of the ScalaFix examples. In particular, according to the standard convention in the Scala world, the source code is in `/home/scalafix/ScalaFixExamples/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples`. Some of these examples are taken from the paper, others are new.

## Examples

The image comes with some examples on the use of ScalaFix which can be executed using `sbt` - Scala Build Tool - the standard build system for Scala.

* Launch the Scala Build Tool with the command `sbt`  from the directory `/home/scalafix/ScalaFixExamples` . You will see the SBT prompt `sbt:ScalaFixExamples>` from which you can give the command `run` .
* Choose the number of the example you want to run. These examples are not particularly significant without looking at the source code. It is possible to browse the source code with either the `emacs` or `vi` text editors, or directly from the GitHub repositories: [https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFix/tree/v0.10.0](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFix/tree/v0.10.0) for  ScalaFix 0.10.0 and [https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/tree/fm2023](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/tree/fm2023) for the FM 2023 branch of ScalaFixExamples.

The following are the examples presented in the paper:

  * [FibonacciExample](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/FibonacciExample.scala): this finds the 6th Fibonacci number using an equation system with an infinite number of unkowns (see Section 2.1 in the paper).
  * [FibonacciFiniteExample](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/FibonacciFiniteExample.scala): this finds the 6th Fibonacci number using an equation system with an finite number of unkowns (see Section 2.2 in the paper).
  * [JPPLBoxExample](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/JPPLExample.scala): anaysis of a simple program with the box domain (see Section 2.3 in the paper).
  * [IPAExample*](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/IPAExample.scala): inter-procedural anayses of a simple program using infinite equation systems (see Section 2.4 in the paper). In particular
    * [IPAExampleBoxWidening](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/IPAExample.scala): uses the interval domain and keeps a single calling context for each function;
    * [IPAExampleBoxNoWidening](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/IPAExample.scala): uses the interval domain and keeps multiple calling contexts for each function;
    * [IPAExamplePolyWidening](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/IPAExample.scala): uses the domain of closed polyhedra and keeps a single calling context for each function;
    * [IPAExamplePolyNoWidening](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/IPAExample.scala): uses the domain of closed polyhedra and keeps multiple calling contexts for each function;
  * [JPPLBoxWithWideningExample](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/JPPLExample.scala): like JPPLBoxExample but with the addition of widenings (see Section 3 in e paper).
  * [JPPLBoxWithWideningAutomaticExample](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/JPPLExample.scala): like JPPLBoxWithWideningExample but widening points are automatically computed by ScalaFix (see Section 3.1 in the paper).
  * [JPPLBoxGraphBasedExample](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/JPPLExample.scala): like JPPLBoxExample, but the equation system is given using the control flow hyper-graph (see Section 4 in the paper).
  * [JPPLBoxLocalizedExample](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/LocalizedExample.scala): analysis of a program with two nested loops using localized widening and narrowing (see Section 4.1 in the paper).
  * [JPPLBoxNotLocalizedExample](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/LocalizedExample.scala): like JPPLBoxLocalizedExample but using standard (non-localized) widening and narrowing (see Section 4.1 in the paper).

  * [ReachingDefinitionsExample](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/ReachingDefinitionsExample.scala): an example of reaching definition analysis taken from the dragon book.
  * [ReachingDefinitionsGraphExample](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/ReachingDefinitionsExample.scala): an example of reaching definition analysis taken from the dragon book implemented using a graph-based equation system.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks may be run from the SBT prompt with `Jmh/run` . Since this executes all the benchmarks, it takes a lot of time (about 125 minutes). It is possible to execute a single benchmark with `Jmh/run <classname>` where `<classname>` may be:

  * [OverheadPPLBench](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/OverheadPPLBench.scala): Benchmarks the equation system (1) in Section 6 using both ScalaFix and ad-hoc solvers. It takes about 100 minutes.
  * [OverheadReachingDefsBench](https://github.com/jandom-devel/ScalaFixExamples/blob/fm2023/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/OverheadReachingDefsBench.scala): Benchmarks the equation system in the `ReachingDefinitionsExample` using both ScalaFix and ad-hoc solvers. It takes about 25 minutes.

## Modify the examples

You may modify the examples using either the `emacs` or `vi` text editors and run them. For instance, if you want to modify FibonacciExample, from the directory `/home/scalafix/ScalaFixExamples` give the command:

`emacs src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafixexamples/FibonacciExample.scala`

Now you can modify the line of code:

`val sol = infinite.WorkListSolver(eqs)(Assignment(1), Set(6))`

which computes the 6th number of Fibonacci with:

`val sol = infinite.WorkListSolver(eqs)(Assignment(1), Set(42))`

to compute the 42nd number of Fibonacci. Then give the commands `sbt` and `run` and choose the example `it.unich.scalafixexamples.FibonacciExample`.

## Scalafix Source code

The directory `/home/scalafix/ScalaFix` contains a copy of the Scalafix source code. In particular:

  * `/home/scalafix/ScalaFix/core/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafix/` contains the ScalaFix source code;
  * `/home/scalafix/ScalaFix/core/src/test/scala/it/unich/scalafix/` contains the unit tests;
  * `/home/scalafix/ScalaFix/bench/src/main/scala/it/unich/scalafix/jmh/` contains benchmarks.

From the `/home/scalafix/ScalaFix` directory you can run the ScalaFix unit tests with `sbt` and, from the SBT prompt `sbt:scalafix>` , give the command `test` (note that this SBT prompt is different from the previous one since you must be in the `/home/scalafix/ScalaFix` directory). From the same SBT prompt you can execute the benchmarks with `bench/Jmh/run` (it takes about 56 minutes; these benchmarks are different from the ones described above and in the paper).

## Docker

The Dockerfile which generates the Docker image is available in the directory `/home/scalafix/ScalaFixExamples/docker`.
