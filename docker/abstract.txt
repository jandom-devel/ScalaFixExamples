This artefact is a docker image containing both ScalaFix, the fixpoint library, and ScalaFixExample, the collection of all
the examples and benchmarks shown in the paper. Both the source code and compiled bytecode are provided. Moreover, the image
contains all the libraries, compilers and tools needed to execute examples and benchmarks, which may be eventually modified
and recompiled if desired.

Due to this issue [https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/9f6b562dd12ef7b1f9e2f8e6f2ab6477790a6594],
a recent version of Docker is required (20.10.16 or later should be fine).

All the examples (and more) shown in the paper are available in this artefact. Moreover, it should be possible to reproduce
all the results of the benchmarks. Obviously, absolute performance values will vary from a machine to the other. In particular,
the results shown in the paper have been obtain with an Intel Core i2500K, 16 GB RAM, clockefixed at 1.6GHz and Turbo Boost
disabled.
